# fxhash-fun

Slowly building a generative art project for the https://www.fxhash.xyz/ platform. 

Based on the fxhash simple boilerplate: https://github.com/fxhash/fxhash-simple-boilerplate

"Tumbling Glyphs" is an experiment of making art with HTML, CSS, and JS. And it's fun!
The "mint" theme has a one in ten chance, and "pale purp" has a two in ten chance... will you catch one of those? 

Also of note, the "live view" is full screen, so visit that view if you want to screen grab a bigger image for a desktop wallpaper. 

Enjoy!
